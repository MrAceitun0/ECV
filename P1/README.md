We have created a chat application for web browsers using HTML+CSS+Javascript and the SillyServer framework provided by Javier Agenjo.

## Features
The user will start in an initial site where he/she can:

* Users can select their nickname
* Users have a pool of 3 different rooms (general, gaming and offtopic) to connect
* Users have 6 predefined options to select a profile image. IMPROVEMENT: selected image is highlighted.

Whenever the user has finished selecting his/her personal information, the connection with the server and the selected room will be done.
* All users in the same chat room can send and recieve messages
* All messages will show the name of the author and their IDs
* When a new user connects, all existing messages will be sent to the new user
* Users can send private messages to others using this example: #userID <message> (the userID will appear next to the name of the user if they send a message)
* Users can send emojis to the room chat pressing the emoji buttons
* The chat room will show the number of users connected in the room
* Whenever a new user is connected, all users that are connected in the same chat room will receive a message informing about the arrival of a new user. IMPROVEMENT: when a user is disconnected all users that are connected in the same chat room will receive a message informing that the user left the room
* All users connected are shown in a list displaying their image and username
